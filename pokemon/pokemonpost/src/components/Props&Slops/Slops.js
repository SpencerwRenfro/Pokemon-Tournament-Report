      <h2>Props</h2>
      <p>• My boys, my fellas, my team. For always being there and supporting me through this season. Every one of you made the wins sweeter and the bad beats softer.</p>
      <p>• Henry Brand for being one of the nicest opponents I've ever played. Best of luck on top 4 and the Worlds stipend.</p>
      <p>• Azul for being an awesome person and accepting my meek request for coach even when you were surrounded by friends.</p>
      <h2>Slops</h2>
      <p>• Team North West. They cannot run events and don't deserve any more.</p>
      <p>• Me forgetting to discard Boss’s Orders making Grant think I'm a cheater</p>
    </div>
